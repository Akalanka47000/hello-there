# HELLO THERE

Just a simple application which you can use like a business card to share your CV with a single QR scan. 

The primary motivation for an app like this is for those who have their CVs in a place like a Google Drive or a Dropbox and want to share it with someone else in a quick and easy way.

## How to use

1. Enter your CV link in the input field at the welcome screen.

2. Show another person the QR code that appears on the screen from this point on once you open the app at any time
